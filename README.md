# Glasgow Python Meetup 2023-05

Repo containing the material used for the talk.


## Getting started

I'll assume you have [poetry installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

- To install the project, just run `poetry install`.
- Download the demo data using the *scripts/download_and_prep_data.py*

A list of shortcut actions is provided under `poetry run poe` (e.g. `poetry run poe dev` to start the local dagster environment)
